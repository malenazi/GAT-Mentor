    "text": "Six friends (P, Q, R, S, T, U) sit around a circular table with 6 seats. Constraints: (1) P and Q must sit opposite each other. (2) R must sit next to P. (3) S must NOT sit next to Q. (4) T sits next to U. (5) S sits next to R. If the seats are numbered 1-6 clockwise and P sits in seat 1, who sits in seat 4?",

    "explanation": "Step 1: P is in seat 1. In a 6-seat circular table, the seat directly opposite seat 1 is seat 4 (three seats apart).\nStep 2: Constraint (1) says P and Q must sit opposite each other.\nStep 3: Since P is in seat 1, Q must be in seat 4.\nStep 4: This is determined directly from constraint (1) alone — regardless of where R, S, T, and U sit, Q must be opposite P.\nAnswer: Q (a)",
