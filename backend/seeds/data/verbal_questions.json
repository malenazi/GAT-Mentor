Most modern linguists reject this strong form, as ample evidence shows that people can think about concepts their language lacks specific words for. However, the weak form of the hypothesis\u2014linguistic relativity\u2014has found substantial empirical support. Studies have shown, for example, that speakers of languages with more color terms can distinguish between shades more quickly than speakers of languages with fewer color terms.

In a classic experiment by Kahneman, Knetsch, and Thaler, participants who were given coffee mugs demanded significantly higher prices to sell them than other participants were willing to pay to buy identical mugs. This asymmetry between willingness to accept and willingness to pay cannot be explained by standard economic theory, which assumes that an item's value is independent of ownership. The endowment effect is thought to be driven by loss aversion\u2014the psychological principle that losses feel approximately twice as painful as equivalent gains feel pleasurable. Parting with a possessed item is framed as a loss, triggering a disproportionate emotional response that inflates the item's perceived value.
